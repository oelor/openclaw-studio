New tiles default to global. Add quick actions: “Use default”, “Open folder”, “Copy path”.\\nB) Workspace Profiles: settings manages named profiles (e.g., studio-research, studio-engineer), each with workspacePath (+ optional defaults like model/agentId). Tiles select a profile. Provides consistency + avoids path typos.\\nC) Multi-project / multi-canvas: treat each workspace as a Project tab (each tab has its own canvas + tiles). Mission Control becomes a top-level project switcher with global overview.\\n\\nRecommendation (phased):\\nPhase 1 (unlock parallelism quickly): implement A (per-tile workspace override + UI badge + quick open/copy).
