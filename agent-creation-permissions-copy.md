# Agent creation permissioning copy (pre-removal)

Source: `2e33f60` removed guided creation files and the copy came from its parent
tree (`2e33f60^`).

### Step headers

- `Define Ownership`
- `Assign full accountability.`

### Authority profiles

- `Runs system actions with approval`
- `Uses web access for context`

- `Autonomous`
- `Acts independently.`
- `Can modify your codebase directly`
- `Can operate your system automatically`
- `Uses web access while iterating`

### Authority summary text

### Step/action and control labels

- `Recommended`
- `Conservative autonomy profile`
- `Collaborative autonomy profile`
- `Autonomous autonomy profile`
- `Web access off`
- `Web access on`
- `File changes on`
- `Command execution off`
- `Command execution ask first`
- `Command execution auto`

### Modal summary section

- `This agent will be accountable for:`
- `This agent will:`
- `Authority:`
- `On launch it will:`
- `What does this agent fully own?`
- `This agent will be accountable for:`

### Other launch text

- `Agent name`

## `src/features/agents/creation/compiler.ts` copy

### Starter and template copy (permission-relevant intent)

- `Evidence-first synthesis with broad access defaults.`
- `Safe code changes with broad execution defaults.`
- `High-autonomy coding with broad execution permissions.`
- `Campaign drafting defaults with broad access.`
- `Follow-up and planning support with broad defaults.`
- `General-purpose baseline with broad defaults.`

### Boundaries / control language

- `Do not publish, send, or launch externally without approval.`
- `Evidence beats intuition when stakes are non-trivial.`
- `Unknowns should be visible, not hidden.`
- `A concise synthesis is more useful than a long dump.`
- `Correctness and reversibility come before speed.`
- `Small scoped changes reduce operational risk.`

### Control mode defaults

- `Agent name is required.`
- `Auto exec cannot be enabled when approval security is set to deny.`
- `Auto exec requires runtime tools to be enabled.`

### Capability summary copy

- `Persona files: custom IDENTITY.md + SOUL.md; AGENTS.md remains the gateway default.`
- `Web access is enabled for search and fetch tools.`
- `Web access is disabled.`
- `Can apply file edits directly on the host filesystem.`
- `Sessions run without sandbox isolation.`
- `Command execution is disabled.`
- `Can run commands automatically without approval prompts.`
- `Can run commands with approval prompts.`

### Execution role/profile summaries generated by compile

- `No command execution.` (from conservative mapping in inspect/derived role view in same era)
- `Commands require approval.`
- `Can operate your system automatically.` (mode summaries and tooltips)

## Notes

- This is a copy extraction for restoration/reuse, not a diff.
- The live strings came from the commit that removed the guided creation flow.
